* **Finding SCADA systems using ports**
Since modbus mostly runs on port 502 I tried to explore more based on that, it led me to multiple open ports where in some of the cases the vulnerabilities were already listed based on the software and version. I also explored other ports such as 19999,20000,etc. 

* **Finding SCADA systems by PLC name**
I tried to find some by entering the tag *Schneider Electric* under which I got 3000 results and to narrow it down I added another keyword SAS(Schneider Automated ELectric).
